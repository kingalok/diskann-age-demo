# DiskANN and Apache AGE Demo Architecture Design

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture design for demonstrating DiskANN and Apache AGE graph extension capabilities within PostgreSQL Flexible Server. The demonstration leverages the MovieLens dataset to showcase both vector similarity search through DiskANN and graph analytics through Apache AGE, providing a practical example of how these technologies can work together to enable advanced data analysis and recommendation systems.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The demo architecture consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide a comprehensive demonstration of both DiskANN and Apache AGE capabilities. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and easily deployable on PostgreSQL Flexible Server.

### 1.1 Core Components

The architecture comprises four primary components: the PostgreSQL Flexible Server with extensions, the data ingestion layer, the embedding generation service, and the demonstration interface. Each component serves a specific purpose in showcasing the capabilities of DiskANN and Apache AGE.

PostgreSQL Flexible Server acts as the central data repository and processing engine. It hosts the MovieLens dataset in traditional relational tables while simultaneously supporting vector operations through the pgvector extension and graph operations through Apache AGE. This dual capability demonstrates how modern PostgreSQL can serve as a unified platform for diverse data processing needs.

The data ingestion layer handles the transformation and loading of MovieLens data into appropriate PostgreSQL structures. This includes not only the traditional relational data but also the preparation of data for graph representation and vector embedding generation.

The embedding generation service creates vector representations of movies and users based on their characteristics and behaviors. These embeddings enable similarity searches through DiskANN, demonstrating how machine learning-derived features can be efficiently indexed and queried at scale.

The demonstration interface provides interactive access to both DiskANN and Apache AGE capabilities, allowing users to execute various queries and observe the performance characteristics of each technology.

### 1.2 Technology Stack

The technology stack is carefully selected to provide optimal performance and compatibility across all components. PostgreSQL Flexible Server serves as the foundation, enhanced with pgvector for vector operations and Apache AGE for graph functionality.

Python serves as the primary programming language for data processing, embedding generation, and demonstration scripts. The choice of Python enables leveraging rich machine learning libraries for embedding generation while maintaining compatibility with PostgreSQL through established database connectors.

For embedding generation, the architecture utilizes pre-trained transformer models through the Sentence Transformers library, enabling the creation of high-quality vector representations without requiring extensive training infrastructure.

## 2. Data Architecture

### 2.1 Relational Schema Design

The relational schema follows the natural structure of the MovieLens dataset while incorporating extensions necessary for vector and graph operations. The design maintains referential integrity while optimizing for both traditional SQL queries and the specialized operations required by DiskANN and Apache AGE.

The users table stores demographic information and user preferences, extended with a vector column for user embeddings. This design enables both traditional demographic analysis and vector-based similarity searches for finding users with similar preferences.

The movies table contains movie metadata including title, release information, and genre classifications. Like the users table, it includes a vector column for movie embeddings, enabling content-based similarity searches and recommendations.

The ratings table captures user-movie interactions with ratings and timestamps. This table serves as the foundation for both collaborative filtering algorithms and graph relationship modeling in Apache AGE.

### 2.2 Vector Data Design

Vector embeddings are designed to capture semantic relationships between entities in a format optimized for DiskANN operations. Movie embeddings incorporate multiple dimensions of similarity including genre preferences, content characteristics derived from titles, and collaborative signals from user ratings.

User embeddings reflect individual preferences and behaviors, combining demographic information with rating patterns and genre preferences. The embedding dimension is standardized across all entities to enable cross-entity similarity comparisons where appropriate.

The vector design considers both accuracy and performance requirements. Embedding dimensions are chosen to balance expressiveness with computational efficiency, ensuring that DiskANN operations remain performant even as the dataset scales.

### 2.3 Graph Schema Design

The graph schema in Apache AGE models the MovieLens domain as a bipartite graph with users and movies as distinct node types connected through rating relationships. This design enables sophisticated graph analytics while maintaining clear semantic meaning.

User nodes contain properties reflecting demographic information and computed characteristics such as average rating behavior and genre preferences. Movie nodes include metadata properties and computed features such as average ratings and popularity metrics.

Rating edges capture not only the rating value but also temporal information, enabling time-aware graph analytics and the modeling of preference evolution over time.

## 3. DiskANN Integration Architecture

### 3.1 Index Strategy

DiskANN indexes are strategically designed to optimize for the most common query patterns in recommendation systems. Separate indexes are created for movie and user embeddings, each tuned for their specific access patterns and performance requirements.

The movie embedding index is optimized for content-based similarity searches, where users seek movies similar to ones they have enjoyed. The index configuration balances search accuracy with query latency, ensuring responsive user experiences.

The user embedding index supports collaborative filtering scenarios, enabling the identification of users with similar preferences for recommendation generation. The index parameters are tuned to handle the typically smaller user embedding space while maintaining high recall for similarity searches.

### 3.2 Performance Optimization

Performance optimization for DiskANN involves careful tuning of index parameters including graph connectivity, search beam width, and memory allocation. These parameters are adjusted based on the characteristics of the MovieLens dataset and expected query patterns.

Memory management is particularly important for DiskANN performance. The architecture allocates sufficient memory for index caching while ensuring that the system remains responsive under concurrent load. Disk I/O patterns are optimized to minimize latency for vector similarity searches.

Query optimization includes the implementation of appropriate distance metrics for different types of similarity searches. Cosine similarity is used for content-based searches, while Euclidean distance may be more appropriate for certain demographic-based user similarities.

### 3.3 Scalability Considerations

The DiskANN architecture is designed to scale with growing datasets and query loads. Index partitioning strategies are implemented to handle larger embedding spaces, while query routing ensures optimal resource utilization.

Horizontal scaling capabilities are built into the design, allowing for the distribution of vector operations across multiple PostgreSQL instances when necessary. This approach maintains the benefits of DiskANN while providing a path for handling enterprise-scale workloads.

## 4. Apache AGE Integration Architecture

### 4.1 Graph Modeling Strategy

The graph modeling strategy in Apache AGE focuses on capturing the essential relationships in the MovieLens domain while enabling efficient traversal and analysis operations. The bipartite graph structure naturally represents user-movie interactions while supporting extension to more complex relationship types.

Node design incorporates both static properties derived from the original dataset and computed properties that enhance graph analytics capabilities. These computed properties include centrality measures, clustering coefficients, and other graph-theoretic metrics that provide insights into the structure of user preferences and movie popularity.

Edge design captures not only the basic rating relationship but also derived features such as rating deviation from user or movie averages, temporal patterns, and relationship strength indicators. These enhanced edge properties enable more sophisticated graph analytics and recommendation algorithms.

### 4.2 Query Optimization

Query optimization for Apache AGE involves the strategic use of indexes and query planning to ensure efficient graph traversals. Indexes are created on frequently accessed node and edge properties to accelerate common query patterns.

Path-finding algorithms are optimized for the specific characteristics of the MovieLens graph, taking advantage of its bipartite structure to reduce search space and improve performance. Specialized algorithms for recommendation generation are implemented to leverage graph topology effectively.

Caching strategies are employed to improve performance for frequently executed graph queries. This includes both result caching for expensive analytical queries and intermediate result caching for complex multi-step graph traversals.

### 4.3 Analytics Capabilities

The Apache AGE integration provides comprehensive analytics capabilities including community detection, influence analysis, and recommendation generation. These capabilities demonstrate the power of graph-based approaches to understanding complex relationship patterns in user behavior data.

Community detection algorithms identify groups of users with similar preferences or movies that appeal to similar audiences. These insights can inform content acquisition strategies and targeted marketing campaigns.

Influence analysis identifies key users whose preferences significantly impact others, enabling the identification of opinion leaders and early adopters. This information is valuable for viral marketing strategies and product launch planning.

## 5. Integration and Interoperability

### 5.1 Cross-Technology Queries

The architecture enables sophisticated queries that leverage both DiskANN and Apache AGE capabilities within single operations. These hybrid queries demonstrate the power of combining vector similarity search with graph analytics to generate more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations.

For example, a recommendation query might use DiskANN to identify movies similar to a user's highly-rated films, then use Apache AGE to analyze the graph structure around those movies to identify additional recommendations based on community preferences and social signals.

### 5.2 Data Consistency

Data consistency across relational, vector, and graph representations is maintained through carefully designed update procedures and consistency checks. Changes to the underlying relational data trigger appropriate updates to both vector embeddings and graph structures.

Transaction management ensures that updates to different data representations remain synchronized, preventing inconsistencies that could affect query results or system performance.

### 5.3 Performance Monitoring

Comprehensive performance monitoring tracks the behavior of both DiskANN and Apache AGE operations, providing insights into system performance and optimization opportunities. Metrics include query latency, index utilization, memory consumption, and accuracy measures for similarity searches and graph analytics.

Monitoring data is used to continuously optimize system performance and identify potential scaling bottlenecks before they impact user experience.

## 6. Deployment Architecture

### 6.1 PostgreSQL Flexible Server Configuration

The PostgreSQL Flexible Server deployment is configured to optimize for both vector and graph operations while maintaining excellent performance for traditional relational queries. Memory allocation is carefully balanced between different workload types to ensure optimal resource utilization.

Extension management ensures that both pgvector and Apache AGE are properly installed and configured with appropriate parameters for the demonstration workload. Version compatibility is verified to ensure stable operation across all components.

### 6.2 Security and Access Control

Security architecture implements appropriate access controls for different types of operations while maintaining the flexibility needed for demonstration purposes. Role-based access control ensures that different user types have appropriate permissions for their intended operations.

Data protection measures include encryption at rest and in transit, ensuring that sensitive user information in the MovieLens dataset is appropriately protected even in a demonstration environment.

### 6.3 Monitoring and Maintenance

Operational monitoring provides real-time visibility into system health and performance across all components. Automated alerting identifies potential issues before they impact demonstration activities.

Maintenance procedures ensure that indexes remain optimized and that system performance continues to meet expectations as the demonstration evolves and potentially scales to larger datasets.

This comprehensive architecture design provides a solid foundation for demonstrating the capabilities of both DiskANN and Apache AGE within PostgreSQL Flexible Server, showcasing how these technologies can work together to enable advanced analytics and recommendation systems.
